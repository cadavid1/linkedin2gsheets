# Privacy Policy

### 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the LinkedIn to Google Sheets Extension ("the Extension") handles your data.

### 2. Information We Collect

The Extension does not collect or store any personal information beyond what is necessary for its core functionality.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

*   **Google Drive**: Any spreadsheets created by the Extension are stored directly in your Google Drive, under your control. The Extension does not retain copies of this data on its own servers. You are responsible for managing and deleting this data from your Google Drive.

### 4. Data Security

*   **Local Processing**: All data processing, including the extraction of LinkedIn posts and the preparation for export to Google Sheets, occurs locally within your browser. This means your data is not transmitted to or stored on any external servers operated by the Extension's developers.
*   **OAuth 2.0**: The Extension uses Google's secure OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication with your Google account. Your Google credentials are never accessed or stored by the Extension.
*   **No Tracking**: The Extension does not use analytics, tracking cookies, or any other mechanisms to monitor your usage or collect personal information.

### 5. Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts with the following third-party services:

*   **LinkedIn**: The Extension accesses your saved posts directly from the LinkedIn website. Your interaction with LinkedIn is governed by LinkedIn's own Privacy Policy.
*   **Google Sheets API**: The Extension uses the Google Sheets API to create and populate spreadsheets in your Google Drive. Your use of Google Sheets and Google Drive is governed by Google's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The Extension does not share your data with any other third parties.

### 6. Your Choices and Controls

*   **Permissions**: You control the permissions granted to the Extension through your browser and your Google account. You can revoke these permissions at any time.
*   **Uninstalling the Extension**: You can uninstall the Extension from your browser at any time. Uninstalling the Extension will remove all locally stored data associated with it. Data already exported to your Google Drive will remain there until you delete it.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on its associated documentation. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
